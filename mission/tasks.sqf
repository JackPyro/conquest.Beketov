Mission making checklist helper
1. Create loadouts.
2. Test loadouts, check mags and equipment, AI units won't have items, part of acre optimization. You can switch between units on the fly in editor, press U.
3. Create tasks.
4. Test tasks, you'll have admin teleport and admin invincibility options in editor (murshun menu/enable admin actions).
5. Right around here you can start placing custom objects and bases.
6. Generate AI using DAC or any other AI spawner, framework has some functions for AI creation.
7. Test balance, don't use too many AI, something around 100 units is enough.
8. Final touches, change mission name and author in the editor (attributes/general) and in the description.ext file.
9. Change weather and date to your liking.
